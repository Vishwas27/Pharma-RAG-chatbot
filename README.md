# Pharma RAG Chatbot 💊🤖

### **Overview**
This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot, built to assist pharmaceutical sales representatives in answering inquiries about 10 medicinal products. The chatbot utilizes **ChatGPT** to generate accurate, research-backed responses from product PDFs. The target users are healthcare professionals (doctors, hospitals) in the USA, where the chatbot provides detailed information, including usage instructions, side effects, and efficacy data, all while citing the original sources.

### **Objective**  
Empower pharmaceutical sales reps to quickly and accurately address client queries about new medicines by utilizing AI to reference product research and data, allowing sales reps to focus on relationship-building and sales activities. 🚀

### **How it Works** 🔍💬

1. **RAG Architecture**  
   The chatbot uses **RAG** to combine **retrieval** of relevant research data from 10 product PDFs and **generation** of natural language responses. Here’s the process:
   - **Retrieval**: When a question is asked, the system searches through the indexed PDFs, retrieves relevant sections, and ranks them based on relevance.
   - **Generation**: The retrieved information is then fed into **ChatGPT**, which generates a concise and coherent response, citing the exact PDF page and section for reference. 📑

2. **Product-Specific Information**  
   Each of the 10 PDFs corresponds to a unique medicinal product. These documents contain:
   - How healthcare professionals should use the product 🏥
   - Supporting research data, clinical trials, and efficacy studies 📚
   - Potential side effects and safety information ⚠️
   - Dosage recommendations 💉
  
   The chatbot is designed to intelligently reference this data and provide thorough responses to inquiries from healthcare providers.

3. **Integration of ChatGPT**  
   **ChatGPT** is used to generate well-structured, conversational responses. It ensures that the chatbot is able to:
   - Formulate answers in a natural, user-friendly manner 🗣️
   - Cite the research source correctly, adding credibility to the answers by mentioning page numbers and document links 📄
   - Handle follow-up questions, making the conversation fluid and insightful 🔄

4. **Why RAG?**  
   The RAG architecture is ideal for this use case because it allows:
   - **Accurate retrieval**: Ensures the chatbot pulls factual information directly from authoritative sources, eliminating hallucinations or incorrect responses ✅
   - **Efficient response generation**: Generates easy-to-understand responses without overwhelming the user with technical jargon. 📢

### **Project Workflow** 🛠️

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - 10 PDFs of different medicinal products are uploaded. These PDFs contain everything from product usage to detailed research findings. 📑  
   
2. **Document Indexing**  
   - The text from the PDFs is extracted and indexed using embedding techniques, allowing the chatbot to search for relevant sections when a query is made. 🔍  
   
3. **Querying and Retrieval**  
   - The sales rep or healthcare professional asks a question (e.g., "What is the recommended dosage for Product A?").  
   - The RAG system searches the indexed data to find the most relevant passages from the PDFs. 💡  

4. **Answer Generation**  
   - Once the most relevant passages are retrieved, **ChatGPT** generates a clear and precise answer, along with the cited source from the research PDF (e.g., "As per the research, the recommended dosage is 100mg/day. Refer to page 12 of the PDF for more details").  

5. **Response Delivery**  
   - The chatbot delivers the response to the user, along with citations, helping the reps make data-driven decisions and improve communication with healthcare professionals. 📬
